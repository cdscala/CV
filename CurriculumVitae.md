## About Me

I‚Äôm a **Computer Engineer** currently working as a **Systems Engineer** within a large-scale product team focused on the **user experience of a high-traffic TV streaming platform**. My role blends **solution architecture** with hands-on software development, where I specialize in **integrating external systems**, building **sustainable libraries**, and maintaining **clean, high-performance codebases**.

I‚Äôm passionate about software semantics and syntax alike: from choosing the right **design patterns**, enforcing architectural consistency, and boosting system performance, to improving developer experience through reusable, maintainable solutions. I approach every challenge with a mindset rooted in **clarity, precision, and long-term scalability**.

What drives me is not only solving technical problems, but also understanding the broader product and business context‚Äîensuring that every architectural decision supports a better user experience and stronger platform evolution.

**Currently looking for senior or architectural roles where I can combine hands-on engineering with business-driven solution design.**
